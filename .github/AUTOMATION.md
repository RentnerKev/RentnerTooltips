# Repository automation

CI cancels superseded checks. npm publication serializes the stable `latest` destination; release notes serialize each release without cancelling writes. Releases must be published stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags whose committed package identity and exact tag commit match a main ancestor. The pipeline does not rewrite versions.

Privileged scripts execute from trusted main, while release builds use the validated exact tag. Dependabot metadata executes trusted base code. Auto-merge verifies the current run/attempt, workflow identity and unchanged definition, bot-authored verified commits, exact head, and one digest-bearing minor/patch marker before approving that commit and enabling guarded auto-merge. Artifacts are data, never executable publisher input.

Publication compares the packed tarball's SHA-512 integrity with npm, refuses version collisions, and verifies the resulting stable channel. Existing banner assets are reused only with a matching SHA-256 digest and are never clobbered. Managed release notes replace only their explicit marker section; author notes remain outside it. Concurrent author changes detected before an update cause a safe failure. GitHub does not offer an atomic body compare-and-swap through this API; maintainers should avoid simultaneous manual and automated edits.

PR title checks use read-only `pull_request_target` and trusted base code without a PR checkout. Workflow lint executes a checksum-verified actionlint installer from trusted base. A fixed, checksum-verified bootstrap handles first adoption when the base has no installer yet. CI scripts are TypeScript; shell only orchestrates download, checksum verification and extraction.

Dependabot covers root/playground Bun locks and pinned Actions, with a one-day version-update cooldown and minor/patch groups. Majors remain separate. Required labels must be provisioned before enabling label consumers: `dependencies`, `bun`, `github-actions`, `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `security`, `ci`. Cooldown does not intentionally delay security fixes. Existing CodeQL and redacted Gitleaks coverage remain in place.

Security labels are assigned only to verified vulnerability fixes using platform metadata or maintainer review; the read-only metadata workflow does not write labels or infer security from SemVer. Commit-based notes classify `fix(security):`, `chore(security):` and `deps(security):` ahead of routine changes; labels alone do not alter generated commit categories.

Checks: `tsc --noEmit -p .github/scripts/tsconfig.json`, automation unit tests under `src/tests/automation`, actionlint, and shellcheck. Verify actual GitHub job and npm OIDC behavior after integration; local tests never publish or merge.
